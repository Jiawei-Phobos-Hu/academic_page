			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
                I am a finance PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas. I expect to graduate in 2026.
		My research interests lie in behavioral finance, household finance, and asset pricing. My current agenda examines the impact of behavioral biases on household financial decision-making and their subsequent consequences.

		This paper examines the role of behavioral traits in borrowers' decisions during mortgage 
applications. Analyzing a large sample of mortgages originated between 2005 and 2007, we investigate the 
impact of local gambling preferences on second-lien misrepresentation and its subsequent effect on loan 
performance using OLS, probit, and causal forest approaches. Our findings indicate that second-lien 
misrepresentation is more prevalent in areas with higher local gambling preferences. Furthermore, loans with 
second-lien misrepresentation in high gambling preference areas exhibit poorer performance compared to 
those in low gambling preference areas. Utilizing RDD and difference-in-discontinuities approaches, we 
compare the number of loans and default rates around a FICO score of 620 between high and low gambling 
preference areas. Our results suggest that the influence of gambling preferences on misrepresentation is more 
likely attributable to borrower behavior rather than lender practices. </a>

		Recent studies find that cumulative prospect theory can explain stock returns in the
		cross-section. We find that the explanatory power varies with the estimated probability
		weights from the empirical pricing kernel. Allowing time-varying probability weights
		strengthens the support for the cumulative prospect theory in explaining stock returns
		beyond existing return predictors and time-varying stock characteristics. A conditional
		strategy based on time-varying probability weights significantly improves the performance of the unconditional strategy.

<!--		<strong>Conference presentation:</strong> <br>  -->
		Can financial technology level the playing field for female financial advisors? 
		In the setting of copy trading on a social trading platform, we find that female lead traders attract more investors than male lead traders, 
		controlling for performance, risk, trader characteristics, and country and time fixed effects. 
		This finding is more pronounced among traders engaging in high-risk trading, or in countries with more women participating in the labor force. 
		In the dynamic relation of investor flow responding to tradersâ€™ performance, 
		we find a more convex relation between performance and flow for female lead traders, 
		in that female traders attract more investors with good performance and lose fewer investors with poor performance than male traders. 
		Using Baidu AI face detection, we find that older and less attractive female lead traders attract more investors. 
		Our findings indicate that investors on the social trading platform trust female lead traders more.

                with Feng Zhao<br>
<!--		<strong>Conference presentation:</strong> <br>  -->
		Based on Barberis et al. (2021) prospect theory asset pricing model, we build a model
 		that incorporates both expected utility theory term and prospect theory term to study
 		skewness preference. The model is used to explain coskewness premium and idiosyn
		cratic skewness. As expected, prospect theory term mainly responsible for idiosyncratic
 		skewness premium. However, we find that although both terms play a role in explain
		ing coskewness premium, the two terms have competing effects.
